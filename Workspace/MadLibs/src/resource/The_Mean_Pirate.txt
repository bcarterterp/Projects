There once was a mean pirate by the name of Deadnail.

He was the meanest pirate in all the vast sea.

He would kick people in their shin,

He would bite people on their arm,

And he would never tell them "Sorry".

One day he met a small lady.

She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.

He tried to woo her with stolen treasure.

She gave him a stern look and told him 

"Only men with a heart of gold, can she be with".

From that day on, he changed his ways but never saw the lady again
